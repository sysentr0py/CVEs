<b><h2>Description</b></h2>

LimeSurvey <= v6.6.1 uses the Request Host Header to construct the password reset link. This allows an attacker to trick the web application into sending a malicious password reset link to the victim, by specifying an arbitrary domain as the Host Header value.

<b><h2>PoC</b></h2>

To exploit this vulnerability, follow the steps below:

1. Send the password reset request by specifying a second host header with an arbitrary domain as value.

2. Once the request is sent, the malicious password reset link is forwarded to the victim, allowing an attacker to steal the victim's reset password token by clicking on the link.
