<b><h2>Description</b></h2>

SysPass <= v3.2.x doesn't sanitize the filename by allowing a carriage return character to be specified. As a result, the request to retrieve it triggers an error, resulting in the dumping of the web application's source code, including the database password and other sensitive information.
<b><h2>PoC</b></h2>

To exploit this vulnerability, follow the steps below:

1. Create a new account and upload a file with a carriage return character in the filename.
